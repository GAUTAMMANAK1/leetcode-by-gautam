# Maximum Odd Binary Number

## Problem Description

You are given a binary string `s` that contains at least one '1'.

Your task is to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```java
Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".
